                            The brief was to raise awareness of the problems of maternal and newborn death in low income countries, but mainly focus
                            on spreading awareness about the benefits of midwifery and the important role midwives have for ensuring a safe pregnancy and motherhood.
                            The long term goal for maternal and newborn health to be a prioritized topic in every country and government.

                            We used thunderclap, which is a powerful crowd speaking tool, to reach out to as many people as possible.
                            In addition to that we created a twitter recruiter where a country is targeted and influencial twitter users can be encouraged to join the cause.

                            but easily share their private information without any critical thinking.
